# Server-side Web Proof Generation for Kraken API Data

This example demonstrates how to use [vlayer Web Proof](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/web.html) to notarize an HTTP request to:

```
https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=ETHUSD
```

It generates a **zero-knowledge proof (ZK proof)** based on the API response, which can then be verified by an **on-chain EVM smart contract**.

## How to Run

You can find a step-by-step guide for running this example in the vlayer documentation:
